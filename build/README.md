The visual tool for prototyping UI for ReactJS components and Web applications. 
In the builder you can easily combine available components with each other, and see how they look and feel right on a Web page.
Then you can generate a source code of new ReactJS component from the combination. 
 
Tightly integrated with ReactJS Component Exchange. Visit [the project gallery](http://helmetrex.com/Gallery.html) for more information.

Features
--------
* Easily prototype UI of any complexity with available ReactJS components.
* Generate source code for new ReactJS component from any combination of other components.
* Edit source code in other IDEs, the changes automatically will be reflected in the builder workspace.
* Include and use any third-party components or even jQuery plugins in the builder.
* Publish own projects on ReactJS Component Exchange site.
